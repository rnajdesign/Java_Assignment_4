## Architecture
- `model` package: Contains data classes like `Homework`, `Project`, `Task`, and `Subject`.
- `gui` package: Swing UI classes including `AssignmentTrackerGUI` and `TaskTableModel`.

## Persistence
- Saves tasks as serialized Java objects.

## Custom Table Renderer
- Highlights tasks and controls checkbox interaction.
